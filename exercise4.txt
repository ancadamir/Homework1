4. Exercise #4: Providing suggestions
Providing suggestion to improve quality or user experience is the extension of software testing job. So why not try that?
Can you tell how user experience can be improved for the following sign in page?

1. adding the title of the application
2. adding a short text with the instruction: "In order to connect to TEST APPLICATION you need an account"
The logging options displayed are not very explicit. I would prefer to look like this:
2.1. If you have an account, in order to log in, please add your e-mail address and the password.
2.2. If you don't have an account, please create one using your e-mail address.
Add your e-mail address :
Set a password : 
(password security requirements)

I prefere to delete the question :" Do you have password?" because is not very clear . 
If you have an e-mail address that means you have a password - for the e-mail. This password is not reconized by the system if you are a new user (because the customer can set a different password for the TEST APPLICATION account or even if it chooses the same password as the e-mail, it is still not in the system ) , but you add it because you have one. (now the user is confused ).
If you are a new user and the system reconize the password (your e-mail password), that means the security system is not working. You are able to connect with any e-mail account without being registred.

3. If the user chose the option : "No, I am a new customer " he needs an option to create an account. 
4. I prefere to change the button and to add a simple on : "Sign In "
The button : " Sign in on our secure server" it may seem strange to an inexperienced customer.
 In my opinion, the home page should look like this - see the "Homework I.4.jpeg"
